This is a description of my project where I developed two projects under the domain of network sniffing:

1. **Python-based Project**: This Python script is designed to monitor HTTP traffic on a network interface using Scapy. It captures details such as protocol (TCP/UDP), IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, paths, form data, and user-agent information. The captured requests are displayed in a structured table format, highlighting critical details for each request, including browser information and submitted form data.

2. **Web-based Project**: Create a script to capture HTTP requests from the specified website without permission.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Captures and displays HTTP requests and responses in real-time.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Provides comprehensive details like protocol types, IP addresses, ports, and HTTP header contents.
- **User-Agent Parsing:** Extracts and interprets browser and operating system information from user-agent strings.
- **Form Data Extraction:** Decodes and presents form submissions sent via HTTP POST requests.
- **Customizable Filtering:** Allows filtering of specific network traffic patterns for focused monitoring.

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- PrettyTable
- user_agents

## üìñ Usage

1. Run the script (`python networksniff.py`).
2. Observe HTTP traffic on the specified network interface.
3. Terminate monitoring by pressing Ctrl+C.

üîç **HTTP Request Capturing Script**

üåê **Website**: "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php"

üñ•Ô∏è **Supported Platforms**: Linux, Windows

üìù **Objective**: Create a script to capture HTTP requests from the specified website without permission.


### Detailed Installation Instructions:

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation prompts.

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use `pip`, Python's package installer, to install the necessary packages:
     ```
     pip install scapy prettytable user_agents
     ```
   - **Explanation of Packages:**
     - `scapy`: Allows manipulation and capturing of network packets.
     - `prettytable`: Facilitates the creation of formatted tables for displaying captured data.
     - `user_agents`: Parses user-agent strings to extract browser and operating system information.

### Detailed Usage Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If you haven't already, clone or download the repository from GitHub where your script (`networksniff.py`) is hosted.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory (`cd`) into the repository directory where `networksniff.py` is located.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```
     python networksniff.py
     ```
   - Replace `networksniff.py` with the actual filename of your script.

4. **Capturing Network Packets:**
   - Once the script starts running, it will begin capturing HTTP requests made from your network interface.
   - Each captured HTTP request is parsed and displayed in a structured table format.

5. **Stopping the Script:**
   - To stop capturing packets, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt where the script is running.
   - This action terminates the script execution and stops further packet capture.

### Example Usage:

- Upon running `networksniff.py`, the script displays a banner using ASCII art.
- It listens and captures HTTP requests in real-time.
- Each captured HTTP request includes details such as timestamp, protocol (TCP/UDP), IP addresses, ports, HTTP method, path, website, browser info, and form data (if applicable) in a neatly formatted table.

### Additional Notes:

- **Permissions:** Ensure your environment has the necessary permissions to capture network packets. Administrative privileges might be required, depending on your operating system.
