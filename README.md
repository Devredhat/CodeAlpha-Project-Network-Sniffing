This Python script is designed to monitor HTTP traffic on a network interface using Scapy. It captures details such as protocol (TCP/UDP), IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, paths, form data, and user-agent information. The captured requests are displayed in a structured table format, highlighting critical details for each request, including browser information and submitted form data.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Captures and displays HTTP requests and responses in real-time.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Provides comprehensive details like protocol types, IP addresses, ports, and HTTP header contents.
- **User-Agent Parsing:** Extracts and interprets browser and operating system information from user-agent strings.
- **Form Data Extraction:** Decodes and presents form submissions sent via HTTP POST requests.
- **Customizable Filtering:** Allows filtering of specific network traffic patterns for focused monitoring.

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- PrettyTable
- user_agents

## üìñ Usage

1. Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Run the script (`python networksniff.py`).
3. Observe HTTP traffic on the specified network interface.
4. Terminate monitoring by pressing Ctrl+C.
